## Installation
1. Clone the repo to your computer by clicking the green code button and copying the SSH version.

2. Open Gitbash in your desired folder and type ```git clone ``` then right click to paste the string and hit enter. The repo will then be cloned to your computer.

3. Navigate to the repo folder and type ```code .``` into gitbash to open the repo in VS Code.

4. Open a new Terminal in VS Code and type ```npm install``` to install the repo dependencies.

5. Finally, type ```npm run develop``` into the terminal to run the in development version and navigate to localhost:3006 in your web browser.

## Features
Website has a contact form, a projects page with clickable links to deployed sites and GitHub repos. Looks really basic, but I'll learn more with React in time.
